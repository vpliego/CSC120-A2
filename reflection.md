When starting this assignment, I was very confused by the instructions and the pre-written code. It took me a while to figure out what the pre-written code was doing and what my role in the assignment was. I knew the computer.py file needed information regarding the model, year, processor type, hard drive processor, etc. while the oo_resale_shop.py would need information about any computers being sold or bought which would either make the inventory increase or decrease in number. Putting this information together as methods and attributes was least concerning after a while but now that I have run it, I am not convinced by the things being printed in the terminal screen. I realized that this is likely not the proper execution since there is no actual change after each run. I am pretty confused to be honest about what should be added to fix this. I'm wondering if an input function was needed to provide different results. I'm also curious about the inventory function to store new information, how can this be done?
